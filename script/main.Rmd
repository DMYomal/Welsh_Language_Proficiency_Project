# Background to the research

The client is the Welsh Government who are interested in what impacts current residents' self-assessed confidence using the Welsh language.

Data has been obtained from residents of North Wales and South Wales, where respondents were asked a series of questions about themselves, and also to take an assessment of their reading, writing, speaking and listening abilities.

# Data structure

The variables collected for a sample of residents are:

resident - If respondent is 'Current' or 'Former' resident of Wales

area - Resident of 'North' Wales or 'South' Wales

hyder - Self-assessed level of proficiency with the Welsh language, selected using a sliding scale (higher values mean higher confidence)

friends - Estimated number of friends or family members proficient with the Welsh language

year - Year of birth

gender - Gender

read - Reading ability score

write - Writing ability score

speak - Speaking ability score

listen - Listening ability score

# Project START HERE

# Phase 1: Data Preparation

This should include:

-   a knitted Word document.

-   demonstrating the use of an appropriate directory structure, load your individual dataset supplied

-   implement the required data preparation so that only 'Current' residents are included in any analyses. Remove the redundant variable from the dataset.

```{r load data}
#Reader the CSV data
Welsh_Data<-read.csv("../data/welsh_gov.csv",sep=",")
```

```{r dim data , include=FALSE}
#Check the dimensions of the read file
dim(Welsh_Data)
```

```{r structure, include=FALSE}
#Check the data structure of Welsh_Data
str(Welsh_Data)
```

```{r}
#List out the variable names
colnames(Welsh_Data)
```

```{r Q1 data preparation here inclede }
#remove the previous date frame
rm(Welsh_Data)
#load the data set by converting the categorical variables as Factors
welsh_data<-read.csv("../data/welsh_gov.csv",sep=",",header=TRUE,stringsAsFactors = TRUE)

#Convert the year as a factor
welsh_data$year<-as.factor(welsh_data$year)

#Check the structure of the data frame
str(welsh_data)
```

```{r filter the data for current resident}
#Filter the welsh_gov data frame for "Current" residents
filtered_gov <- subset(welsh_data, resident == "Current")

#Remove the 'resident' column from the data frame
filtered_gov <- filtered_gov[, -which(names(filtered_gov) == "resident")]

#Check the dimension of the filtered_gov
dim(filtered_gov)
```

```{r}
#Check whether there is any "na" and "null" values
sum(is.na(filtered_gov))
sum(is.null(filtered_gov))
```

According to above, there is no any "na" or "null" value. Hence no need to handle the na or null value of the data set

# Phase 2

By producing relevant descriptive statistics for 'area', 'gender and 'year', state what these variables reveal in relation to any further required data preparation prior to analyses, and implement changes as necessary.

```{r Q2}

#summary of age
table_data1<-table(filtered_gov$area)
t1<-as.data.frame(table_data1)
colnames(t1) <- c("Area", "Frequency")
flex_table1 <- flextable(t1)
print(flex_table1)


#summary of gender
table_data2<-table(filtered_gov$gender)
t2<-as.data.frame(table_data2)
colnames(t2) <- c("Gender", "Frequency")
flex_table2 <- flextable(t2)
print(flex_table2)


#summary of year
table_data3<-table(filtered_gov$year)
t3<-as.data.frame(table_data3)
colnames(t3) <- c("Year", "Frequency")
flex_table3 <- flextable(t3)
print(flex_table3)

```

According to the above results, the below preparations are required before analyzing the data

1.Area : In area column, there are 3 missing values and 2 Unknown values. These records need to be removed from the data frame

```{r}
#Remove the Missing and Unknown Area Records
filtered_gov <- subset(filtered_gov, area != "Missing" & area != "Unknown")
summary(filtered_gov$area)
```

2.Gender : When addressing the gender variable, there are three different genders such as "Female", "Male' and"Transgender". There are 5 Transgenders in the data set. Here, the Transgender records have been removed, because it represent only 1% from the data set.

```{r}
#Remove the Transgender Records
filtered_gov <- subset(filtered_gov, gender != "Transgender")
summary(filtered_gov$gender)

```

3.Year : In years, there are incorrect year values such as 36, 41,178, 190. These need to be handle when addressing the data frame and here I have remove them from the data frame

```{r}
#Remove the Incorrect Formatted Yaer Records
categories_to_remove <- c("36", "41","178","190","195")
filtered_gov <- subset(filtered_gov, !(year %in% categories_to_remove))

#Summary of Gender
summary(filtered_gov$year)
```

As above all the three variables has been clean and assigned into filtered_gov data frame

# Phase 3

Create one new variable, calculated as the mean of 'read', 'write', 'speak' and 'listen'.

Test to see if there is a statistically significant linear correlation between the newly calculated variable and 'hyder'.

A statement of the statistical hypotheses; relevant code and output for the statistical test; interpretation and summary of the results.

Calculate the mean and create a new variable called mean_score

```{r Q3}

# Create a new variable as the mean of 'read', 'write', 'speak', and 'listen'
filtered_gov$mean_score <- rowMeans(filtered_gov[, c('read', 'write', 'speak', 'listen')])

```

Here, a scatter plot has been drawn to identify correlation in between Hynder and Mean Score

```{r scatterplot}
plt<-ggplot(filtered_gov, aes(x = mean_score, y = hyder,  colour = gender, alpha = .5))
  
plt+geom_point() + stat_smooth(method = lm, level = 0.99, colour = "black")+labs(title = "Mean Score vs Hyder", x = "Mean Score", y = "Hyder")

```

According to the above scatter plot, a positive correlation can be identified in between 'mean score' and the 'hyder'.

For further analysis,here a null and alternative hypothesis has been developed as below

\$H_0:  = \$ there is no statistically significant linear correlation between 'mean_score' and 'hyder'

\$H_1:  = \$ there is a statistically significant linear correlation between the 'mean_score' and 'hyder'

```{r}

# Perform correlation test
cor_test <- cor.test(filtered_gov$mean_score, filtered_gov$hyder)
#print the correlation results
print(cor_test)

```

```{r}
#generate a report using easystats library
report(cor_test)

```

According to the above Pearson's product moment correlation,there is a statistically significant correlation between mean_score and hyder because the P value (3.548e-10) \< 0.05 in 95% confident interval.Hence according to the hypothesis test, we can reject the null hypothesis and there is evidence to accept the alternative hypothesis.

Here the degree of freedom is 425 and the t value is 6.4247. The correlation between two variable is 0.29 and it is in between 0.21 and 0.38 when the confidence interval is 95%. According to the correlation value, it can be said that there is a week correlation between selected two variables because the correlation lies in between 0.2 \<= \|r\| \< 0.4.

# Phase 4

Descriptive statistics and exploratory graphics to compare the area of 'North' Wales against the area of 'South' Wales. Each output has appropriate interpretation.

```{r Q4}

gov_north <- subset(filtered_gov, area == "North")
gov_south <- subset(filtered_gov, area == "South")

print("summary of hyder score in North Walse")
summary(gov_north$hyder)
print("summary of mean_score in North Walse")
summary(gov_north$mean_score)

print("summary of hyder score in South Walse")
summary(gov_south$hyder)
print("summary of mean_score in South Walse")
summary(gov_south$mean_score)

#Figure1
gender_plot <-
ggplot(filtered_gov, aes(x = area, fill = gender)) + geom_bar(position = "dodge") +geom_text(aes(y = after_stat(count), label = after_stat(count)), stat = "count", position = position_dodge(width = 1), vjust = -0.5)+

       tag = "Q4:Figure 4") + 
  xlab("Area") + 
  ylab("Mean score") + 
  theme_bw()

```

Below the figures have been explained in brief

P4:Figure 1 This bar plot has describe the each areas distribution of data against to the gender. According to the figure 1, in North region, there are 108 female and 84 male records. Also, in South region 130 female and 100 male records can be found.According to the this, the South region higher records in selected sample. In overall, there are more females participants in selected sample than the male.

P4:Figure 2 Here, the number of records have been plotted against the birth year and classified the records by North and South.According to this, high number responses are belongs to the participants who born in 1980, 1981 and 1982 .

P4:Figure 3 Here, hyder has been drafted in box plot against the area later classified by gender. According to these plots,mean of language proficiency in North wales is greater that the south. When comparing gender,North Wales female has the highest mean of language proficiency when comparing with other groups. The is no significance difference of language proficiency mean in between male and female in South Wales.

Figure 4 Here, mean score has been drafted in box plot against the area later classified by gender.According to the figure, there are few out liars in North Wales male & female data records and South Wales female data records. Here mean score's mean is higher than the South Wales male and female means. Also, there is no significant difference in both North Wales male and female means and same as South Wales's male and female means.

# Phase 5:

Create a linear regression with 'hyder' as the dependent variable, and only **one** explanatory variable.

include:

-   justification for the choice of explanatory variable, including any additional supporting exploratory data analyses used to make the choice;

-   interpretation of the slope (gradient) coefficient;

-   comment on the r-square value, and the validity of model assumptions.

```{r Q5}
#create a new data frame for numeric figure is filter_gov data frame

filtered_gov_num<-Filter(is.numeric,filtered_gov)

#calculate the correlation between numeric variables
cor_gov<-cor(filtered_gov_num)

#draw the corr plot matrix
corrplot(cor_gov,method="number",type="lower",diag=FALSE,tl.col = "black",tl.srt = 45, main = "Correlation Matrix Between Numaric Variables", sub = "Q5: Figure 1")
```

```{r}
#find most correlating variable
print("The most correlated variable is :")
which.max(abs(cor_gov["hyder",-1]))

```

According to the P5:Figure 1, write variable can be identify as the most correlated variable with hyder.

Hence, here I have drawn Scatter plot between hyder and write check the above results.

```{r}
plt <- ggplot(data=filtered_gov,aes(x=write,y=hyder,colour=area,shape=area))

#plot the scatter plot between write score and hynder
plt +geom_point()+theme_minimal()+scale_x_continuous(limits = c(70, 100), breaks = seq(70, 100, by = 2))+ stat_smooth(method = lm, level = 0.95, colour = "black")+labs(title = "Write Score vs Hyder Scattor Plot", x = "Write", y = "Hyder",tag = "Q5:Figure 2")

```

According to the above scatter plot, a positive correlation can be identified in between write and hyder score variables. The two regression lines are due to the two areas.

To verify the result, a correlation test has been done in below.

```{r}
#Test the correlation inbetween hyder and write score variables
Cor_test<-cor.test(filtered_gov$hyder,filtered_gov$write)
Cor_test

#Write summary report using eaststat library
report(Cor_test)
```

According to the test results, p value \< 0.05 when considering the confident interval is 95%. The correlation between hyder and write is 0.596 and it is lies in between 0.53 and 0.65. Hence, there is a moderate correlation in between two variables because 0.4 ≤ \|r\| \< 0.6.

Constructing a simple linear regression

```{r}
#Constructing a simple linear regression
mod1<-lm(hyder~write,data=filtered_gov)

#convert the output into a flex table
as_flextable(mod1)
```

```{r, include=FALSE}
report(mod1)
```

$$\mbox{hyder} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times \mbox{writer}+ \beta_x(Other Variables)$$

The linear regression model was fitted to predict the variable "hyder" based on the predictor variable "write" using the lm function.

The model suggests that the "write" variable has a significant impact on the "hyder" variable. The estimated coefficient for "write" is 0.27519, indicating that, on average, for each unit increase in the "write" score, the predicted "hyder" score increases by 0.27519.

The intercept term in the model is -17.90433, which represents the estimated value of "hyder" when the "write" score is zero.

According to above data, the regression line can be written as below.

$$\mbox{hyder} = \ -17.904 + \ 0.275 \times \mbox{writer}+ \beta_x(Other Variables)$$

The multiple R-squared value is 0.3554, indicating that approximately 35.54% of the variability in the "hyder" variable can be explained by the "write" variable.Which means model has been explain 35.54%.

The F-statistic, with a value of 231.6 and degrees of freedom of 1 and 420, suggests that the overall model is highly significant. The associated p-value, which is smaller than 2.2e-16, provides strong evidence against the null hypothesis, indicating that the model is a good fit for the data.

The residuals, representing the differences between the observed and predicted values of "hyder," show a range from -2.60608 to 2.45835. The residual standard error, a measure of the average distance between the observed and predicted values, is 0.8429.

```{r}
#fit the model
check_model(mod1)
```

Summary of Model Fit Graphs:

1.Posterior Predictive Check

The Posterior Predictive Check checks the model predictions align with the observed data.Here, the predicted values closely match the observed values without any systematic deviations or patterns. Hence, we can say that the model is fitted well.

2.Linearity

The linearity plot evaluates the assumption of linearity between the write and hyder variables (predictor and response variable). Here, random scattering of points are plotted around the line. Which means that the linear regression assumption is met.

3.Homogeneity of Variance

This examines whether the variability of the residuals is constant across different levels of the predictor variable. Here, the plot exhibit a random dispersion of points around a horizontal line.Which means the variance of the residuals is consistent.

4.Influential Observation

This identifies data points that exert a significant influence on the model's parameter estimates.Here, the plot exhibits a cluster of data points that are close to the regression line and have low leverage values.

5.Normality of Residuals

This assesses whether the residuals of the model follow a normal distribution.Here,the plot displays that the residuals closely following the diagonal line. Which means they are normally distributed.

# Phase 6: Report

Short report of 300-500 words to the client outlining findings.

-   summary about differences between North Wales and South Wales;

-   summary what could learn about patterns in proficiency ('hyder').

### Background:

This report presents the findings of the analysis done based on the data collected by the Welsh Government to investigate the factors influencing self-assessed confidence in the Welsh language among residents of North Wales and South Wales. The study collected data on various variables related to language proficiency and demographics.

### Data Analysis Findings:

#### Differences between North Wales and South Wales

The analysis revealed that there were more participants from South Wales compared to North Wales. However, there is a significant difference in language proficiency mean scores between the two regions. This means that North Wales participants have higher language proficiency than South Wales participants. But when considering the female and male language proficiency, there is no significant difference between gender in each region. The same is applied to the mean of the average of survey results in listen, speak, write and read.

#### Patterns in Proficiency (Hyder)

The analysis shows a moderate positive correlation (0.596) between language proficiency (Hyder) and the writing ability score. This suggests that individuals with higher writing ability tend to have greater self-assessed confidence in the Welsh language. Apart from that, read and friend factors are also having a positive correlation with language proficiency respectively.

Also, the writing score show that, most of the participants have achieved marks between 76 and 90. Which means the majority of the selected geographic group has a similar level of writing skills.

#### Suggestions for Statistical Model

Based on the analysis, it is recommended to consider additional variables or predictors that could enhance the model's predictive power. Here, the writing score is the only considered variable as the main factor due to its strong relationship to language proficiency. Further, exploring factors such as speaking ability, listening ability, and the number of friends or family members proficient in Welsh may provide valuable insights into language proficiency. These variables can be included in future research models and it may give a better outcome.

Apart from the selected variables, the initial data collection team can add variables like Education Background, Cultural and Social Factors, etc which may give better results.

### Limitations and Conclusion:

1.The analysis identified missing values and outliers in the data set, which were handled accordingly.

2.The sample predominantly consisted of females and further investigation into gender-related differences in language proficiency could be explored.

3.The statistical model explained approximately 35.54% of the variability in language proficiency, indicating room for improvement.

4.Most of the participants were born in the 80's. If the data can be collected from various age groups, language proficiency could be explored by age differences.

In conclusion, this study shed light on the factors influencing language proficiency in North Wales and South Wales. The findings suggest that writing ability plays a significant role in self-assessed confidence in the Welsh language. However, further research considering additional variables and a more balanced gender and age representation would provide a comprehensive understanding of language proficiency in Wales. These insights can be used to assist in developing targeted initiatives to enhance language skills and promote linguistic diversity.
